# Arduino Music Player

CMPUT-274 (Intro to Tangible Computing) final project by @DanishDua and @kenboo98<br/>
An Arduino Music Player built using DFRobot's [DF Player](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1121.html "DF Player A mini...") MP3 module and Adafruit industries' [2.8" TFT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1770 "2.8in TFT...") Touch Shield.

## Getting Started
### Hardware
<img src="https://github.com/dandua98/ArduinoMusicPlayer/raw/master/common/images/setup.jpg" width="500"><br/>
_Speaker missing in this image_<br/>
To set up the hardware and wire it up, check [WIRING.md](https://github.com/dandua98/ArduinoMusicPlayer/blob/master/WIRING.md) for a detailed explanation and schematics.

### Environment setup
The makefile being used can be found at: https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile. Download and follow the instructions to setup this makefile for uploading code to the Arduino. Be sure to change the TAG value of the makefile to your Arduino model. Ex: use mega2560 for Arduino mega<br/>
The makefile in src ([src/Makefile](https://github.com/dandua98/ArduinoMusicPlayer/blob/master/src/Makefile "Makefile")) extends this makefile. Edit line 32 to  your Makefile location:

```Makefile
# Default install location of Arduino Makefile
include /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk
```
Also, you will need to edit your default Arduino directory and Arduino libraries directory.
```Makefile

# line 13
# Arduino UA Directory
ifndef ARDUINO_UA_DIR
ARDUINO_UA_DIR = $(HOME)/arduino-ua
endif

# ------------------------------------------

# line 28
# User Installed Library Location
ifndef USER_LIB_PATH
USER_LIB_PATH = $(ARDUINO_UA_DIR)/libraries
endif

```

DFRobot's DFPlayer is used to handle the mp3 playing. An amplifier circuit and [TMRpcm](https://github.com/TMRh20/TMRpcm "TMRpcm") can be used to play wav files instead (didn't work out for us). It also supports ID3 tag reading (check Deployment for more details) which would make reading music data much more cleaner and would only require one SD card (explained in Deployment). The libraries used are listed in next section. You'll need to download and add them to your default Arduino libraries location.

#### Libraries
##### Arduino core libraries
* [Arduino SD](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD "SD library") library - The default Arduino library for reading/writing SD cards
* [Arduino SPI](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI "SPI library") library - The default Arduino library to communicate with SPI devices, needed to read SD card<br/>

##### Other Libraries
* [DFRobotDFPlayerMini](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU:DFR0299 "DFPlayer") - DF Robot's official library for DF Player, link can be found in wiki under sample code<br/>
* [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library "Adafruit GFX") - Adafruit's core graphics library for displays
* [Adafruit ILI9341](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9341 "Adafruit ILI9341") - Hardware specific library, can find your display specific library at Adafruit's [Github](https://github.com/adafruit?utf8=âœ“ "Adafruit Github") page

## Deployment
As explained in Wiring.md, DF Robot's module does not allow any reading of the SD card data. Another SD card is needed in the TFT screen to hold the music metadata. We wanted to directly read ID3 tags from mp3 files on the SD card in the tft screen but couldn't find any library that worked with the Arduino.
> ID3 tags work by reading either the first 128 or the last 128 bytes of an mp3 file for the song information. Simply offsetting 128 bytes from a file and reading for keyword TAG and then reading the tags should work but all libraries use fstream for that and Arduino doesn't support fstream. You could try reading 128 bytes from a file using SD library and keep on reading until the keyword TAG in the end but that would be quite slow. For more information check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3<br/>

We wrote a python script that converts ID3 tags for an mp3 file to the corresponding txt file that is in a format that can be used by our program. This txt file should be formatted like the following example:<br/>
> Example txt file:<br/>
song:Elephant<br/>
artist:Tame Impala<br/>
album:Lonerism<br/>
time:211.252244898


For album art, we made a python script that converts .png images to the bitmaps of a specified size using [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.x/ "Pillow"), a Python imaging library. Two different folders for different sized bitmaps are needed for SelectScreen (70x70) and PlayScreen (150x150).<br/>
Also, your music files should be labelled as 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3 and so on since that's how DFPlayer reads data. So your final file structure should look like:
```
DF Player SD:
    0001.mp3
    0002.mp3
    0003.mp3
    ...

TFT Player SD:

    icons // for boot screen and buttons bitmaps, check common/icons
        forward.bmp
        reverse.bmp
        pause.bmp
        ...

    texts
        0001.txt
        0002.txt
        0003.txt
        ...

    ssbmaps // small size bitmaps (70x70) for selectScreen
        01.bmp
        02.bmp
        03.bmp
        ...

    psbmaps // large size bitmaps (150x1500) for playScreen
        01.bmp
        02.bmp
        03.bmp
        ...
```

## Run and Usage

The screen being used was 320x240 and to make it easier to edit icon locations and margins for different screens, the locations and sizes are defined in different classes. You can easily edit them to fit you screen. <br/>
For example:<br/>
_from selectscreen.cpp_
```C++
// Icon X and Y refer to 0th index (first on screen) icon
#define ICON_H 70
#define ICON_W 70
#define ICON_ZX 40 // SIDE_W + MARGIN_LR
#define ICON_ZY 15 // MARGIN_TB
```

Also, the pixel distribution has been explained in each file.<br/>
>Note:  If you are using Mac OS X to copy the mp3, the file system will automatically add hidden files like: "._0001.mp3" for index, which this module will handle as valid mp3 files. That's why index for music play and loop in code is 2*index + 1 (to ignore these files). If using windows, please change it to index + 1 or run __dot_clean /Volumes/SDVolumeName__ to delete these files

```C++
// example on line 120 in playscreen.cpp
// music index is 2*index + 1 plus screen index
_musicPlayer->play(2*index + 1);
```

__1.__ Simply touch anywhere on screen to get to the song selection menu, there's a flashing text animation for that!<br/>

<img src="https://github.com/dandua98/ArduinoMusicPlayer/raw/master/common/images/selectscreen.jpg" width="350"><br/>

__2.__ Clicking on an album art on the song selection menu would display it's details. Another click on the same album would take you to the music playing itself. Use left and right arrows (the whole side region would work) to navigate. When returning to the song selection menu , the song will continue playing unless it is paused.<br/>

__3.__ After selecting a song, you are taken to this screen. Clicking on album art takes you back to the song selection menu. The pause button turns to play on click and vice-versa. The plus and minus buttons are used for volume (the grey line is the volume bar). The red bar at the bottom is the progress bar and the forward and backwards arrows take you to next or last song. <br/>
